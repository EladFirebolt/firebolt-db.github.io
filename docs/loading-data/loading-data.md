# Loading data

Loading data into Firebolt is very simple - you can try it in our [getting started tutorial](../getting-started.html). The process is composed of the following steps:

1. Create an external table to connect your external data source to Firebolt - read more [here](./loading-data/working-with-external-tables.html).
2. Create a firebolt table \(FACT/DIMENSION\) - read more on working with tables [here](../concepts/working-with-tables.html).
3. Load data from the external data source into Firebolt using [INSERT INTO](../sql-reference/commands/dml-commands.md#insert-into) command.
