# Connecting to your database programmatically

This section explains how to connect to your database programmatically. If you are using an application like DBeaver that manages your client connections for you, then please skip this section and move directly to the dedicated integration page for that application.

**Prepare in advance:**

Connecting to your database in Firebolt requires authentication. You must provide the following parameters for a successful connection:

* Firebolt username
* Firebolt password
* Database name
* Engine name
