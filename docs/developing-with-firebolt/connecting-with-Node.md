# Connecting with Node.js

To connect to Firebolt with Node.js, please visit our [Node.js SDK page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebolt-sdk).

If you are using an application like DBeaver that manages your client connections, then please skip this section and move directly to the dedicated integration page for that application.

**Prepare in advance:**

Connecting to your database in Firebolt requires authentication. You must provide the following parameters for a successful connection:

* Firebolt username
* Firebolt password
* Database name
* Engine name or url
