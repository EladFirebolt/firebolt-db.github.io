# Connecting with Python

For instructions on how to connect to Firebolt with Python, please visit our [Python SDK page](https://python-sdk.docs.firebolt.io/).

If you are using an application like DBeaver that manages your client connections, then please skip this section and move directly to the dedicated integration page for that application.

**Prepare in advance:**

Connecting to your database in Firebolt requires authentication. You must provide the following parameters for a successful connection:

* Firebolt username
* Firebolt password
* Database name
* Engine name or url
