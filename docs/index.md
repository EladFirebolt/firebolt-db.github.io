# Firebolt documentation
{:.no_toc}
Firebolt is a cloud data warehouse purpose-built for exceptional query performance on massive data sets. Our documentation can help you load and model your data in Firebolt, optimize for performance, and build analytics solutions quickly.

* If you would like to start with a hands-on test drive, jump in with the [Getting started](getting-started.md).
* To understand what's under the hood, check out [Key concepts and architecture](architecture-overview.md) first, and then see [Firebolt cloud data warehouse whitepaper](https://www.firebolt.io/resources/firebolt-cloud-data-warehouse-whitepaper) for more detail.
* If you do not have a Firebolt account, send an email to [hello@firebolt.io](mailto:hello@firebolt.io) to see if Firebolt is a good fit for you.
