# Using indexes to accelerate query performance

Firebolt offers unique technologies that accelerate query performance. Indexes are among the most important. By creating efficient indexes, you can accelerate query performance and use engines more efficiently to save cost. This section covers basic concepts and guidelines for creating each type of index.

This topic assumes you are familiar with Firebolt engines, the basics of Firebolt data ingestion, and the different types of tables in Firebolt. For more information, see [Working with engines](../working-with-engines/working-with-engines.md).
